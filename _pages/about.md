# Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.
# Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.
# Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.

Welcome to my homepage! I'm a fourth-year undergraduate student in the School of Mathematics at Sun Yat-sen University, China. I'm trying hard to survive in fall 2026 graduate program admission.

My interests focus on algebraic geometry, with potential research interests including: algebraic cycles, moduli spaces, derived categories in algebraic geometry and other topics applying those algebraic methods to problems in geometry. 

You can contact me via `Email' at [laiyh36@mail2.sysu.edu.cn.] I look forward to the opportunity to interview or meet with you.
