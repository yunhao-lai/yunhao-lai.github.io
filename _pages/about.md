Welcome to my homepage! I'm a fourth-year undergraduate student in the School of Mathematics at Sun Yat-sen University, China. I'm trying hard to survive in fall 2026 graduate program admission.

My interests focus on algebraic geometry, with potential research interests including: algebraic cycles, moduli spaces, derived categories in algebraic geometry and other topics applying those algebraic methods to problems in geometry. 

You can contact me via `Email` at [laiyh36@mail2.sysu.edu.cn.](http://laiyh36@mail2.sysu.edu.cn) I look forward to the opportunity to interview or meet with you.
